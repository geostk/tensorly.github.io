Tensor regression
=================

TensorLy also allows you to perform Tensor Regression.

Setting
-------

Tensor regression is available in the module :mod:`tensorly.regression`.

Given a series of :math:`N` tensor samples/observations, :math:`\tilde X_i, i={1, \cdots, N}`, and corresponding labels :math:`y_i, i={1, \cdots, N}`, we want to find the weight tesor :math:`\tilde W` such that: 

.. math::

   y = \langle \tilde X, \tilde W \rangle
